=======================

Filename: performances.csv

Location: https://github.com/EAndrade-Lotero/SODCL/blob/master/Data/performances.csv

Behavioral data of 45 dyads playing the "Seek the unicorn experiment" (see https://www.protocols.io/view/seeking-the-unicorn-bts9nnh6). Data was obtained from raw json files output from nodegame.

Method of data collection: nodeGame platform. Freely available at: https://github.com/Slendercoder/Seeking_the_unicorn

Methods of data processing: Dataset generated from raw data via a python script to create a single csv from multiple json output from nodeGame.

Number of variables: 138
Number of rows: 5400
Variables:
* Dyad: name of dyad, which comes from the participants number which nodegame gives to each player.
* Round: number of round of the experiment.
* Player: name of player, which comes from the name of dyad and whether the player is player 1 or 2.
* Answer: submitted answer during round, could be either "Absent" or "Present".
* Time: number of milliseconds from start to finish of the round.
* a11 to a88: whether the tile was visited (1) or not (0). For example, if a34=1, tile on third row fourth column was visited during round.
* b11 to b88: order on which the tile was visited. For example, if b34=5, tile on third row fourth column was the fourth tile to be visited during round.
* Score: score of the round.
* Joint: number of overlapping tiles, that is, tiles visited by both players during round.
* Is_there: whether there was or not a unicorn during round.
* where_x: column where unicorn was placed, or -1 if unicorn absent.
* where_y: row where unicorn was placed, or -1 if unicorn absent.

Location: https://github.com/EAndrade-Lotero/SODCL/blob/master/Data/humans_only_absent.csv

Behavioral data keeping only rounds with unicorn absent and with additional measures (accumulated score, consistency, difference in consistency between players, DLindex, maximum similarity to focal region, best fit focal region) of 45 dyads playing the \'93Seek the unicorn\'94 experiment (https://www.protocols.io/view/seeking-the-unicorn-bts9nnh6).

Method of data collection: Processing of performances.csv.

Methods of data processing: Dataset generated from `performances.csv` via a python script to obtain measures described in [2].
